Background/Client Info:
  For the Gucci Goobers’ final project, we will be working with Andre from Jacob Springs Farm. A number of problems, or inconveniences, were posed at the farm, such as ensuring the chicken coop is closed at night, measuring the remaining water supply of the farm, cueing the ventilation of the greenhouse, etc. We decided, however, on working with the electric fence, which keeps Andre’s livestock in one area. The problem with the electric fence is that it can be grounded very easily (i.e grass touching the fence can cause it to lose functionality). Many of the animals are very obedient, and once they’re shocked once they will not go near the fence again. However, some animals (such as the goats and sheep) are a little more persistent, and will test the fence regularly. If there is no shock emitted by the fence, the goats and sheep will go right through it. The goal of our project is to create a voltage detector, which notifies Andre whenever the fence is shorted out, grounded, or loses charge for any reason. We are working to be able to detect where the fence is grounded in relation to a fixed point. This would save the farmer a great deal of time. Without detecting the location of the shortage, the farmer must walk the entire perimeter of his fence. This is not ideal, and we are aiming to save the farmer as much time as possible. We believe this could benefit livestock farmers at an international level – saving them time and money, and, in turn, allowing them to be more productive.
