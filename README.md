#Design Report

##Background/Client Info:
  For the Gucci Goobers’ final project, we will be working with Andre Houssney from Jacob Springs Farm. A number of problems, or inconveniences, were posed at the farm, such as ensuring the chicken coop is closed at night, measuring the remaining water supply of the farm and cuing the ventilation of the greenhouse, among other things. We decided on working with the electric fence, which contains the livestock. The problem with the electric fence is that it can be taken down very easily through vegetation coming in contact with the fence and grounding the current, or animals breaking the fence. Many of the animals are very obedient, and once they’re shocked once they will not go near the fence again. However, some animals (such as the goats and sheep) are more persistent, and will test the fence regularly. If there is no shock emitted by the fence, the goats and sheep can escape. The goal of our project is to create a device which notifies our client when the fence is down. We would like to be able to detect where the problem is in relation to a fixed point. This would save the client a great deal of time. Without detecting the location of the shortage, they must walk the entire perimeter of the fence. This is not ideal as we are aiming to save the client as much time as possible. We believe this could benefit livestock farmers at an international level; saving them time and money, and, in turn, allowing them to be more productive.


-The non-invasive current sensor reads the current in amperes by measuring the magnetic field that surrounds a circuit.

-The Arduino Pro allows us to program our sensor.

-XBee technology allows us to communicate between different arduinos.

-The electric fence creates an electric circuit with the animal that it shocks and the ground. If the fence is grounded before the current reaches the animal, the animal does not feel any shock.

-Our initial plan was to have four measuring stations located at various locations on the fence. Due to unforeseen costs, we may not be able to have four stations.

-This is a close up view of our initial plan of having a measuring station at each corner of the fence (drawing created using SolidWorks).

##Design Requirements:
- The sensor must be able to 
  - Withstand a voltage of 12000 V.
  - Measure a currents ranging between 0 and 5 Amps of pulsing current.
- The Device must be able to
  - Transmit signal from one corner of the fence to another, and also to the “mother” Arduino. Corners can be between 100 and 2000 feet apart depending on the configuration of the fence.
  - Determine the location of short.
  - Withstand wind, rain, heat, snow and frost.
- The power source must be able to supply 5 volts to power the Arduino.
- The Arduino must be able to send an sms to the clients phone at least once a day and still remain under the budget.
- The production cost must be under 375 Dollars.



##Design Alternatives/Brainstorming
The first step in the project was measuring current/ or voltage to tell if the fence is down.  The options in order to accomplish this where as follows:
- Standard voltmeter or multimeter
- Specialized voltmeter for an electric fence
- Non-invasive current sensor(5 Amps maximum)
  
The  option of a standard voltmeter or multimeter where ruled out early on because the quick pulses of an electric fence would damage these. In addition, a specialized voltmeter costs upward of 70$ and was not within budget because of our goal to have four stations. The non-invasive current senor was a much cheaper option (10$) and would not get damaged, so it was the best option. Specifically a a Amp maximum on the current sensor would yield accurate enough readings.

When a fence becomes grounded, someone must walk around the entire fence in search of what is causing the problem. We wanted to minimized the area that person has to search by either using an algorithm or multiple ensors. The idea of deriving an algorithm that could tell where the grounding issue occured between two sensors was deemed something that could not be done in the instance of a grounded electric fence. However, putting four sensors along the fence would allow us to determine beetween what two sensors the grounding occured at. That way only one fourth of the fence would need to be searched for problems.

The goals for powering the project were that it be reliable and self sufficient. One idea was to draw power from the electric fence itself, however it was not feasible for this project because when the fence becomes grounded, the electronics would lose their power supply. On the other side of the coin, solar panels would be environentaly friendly but could be unreliable at night and on cloudy days. Having a solar panel charge a battery would make a much more reliable power source because there would be extra charge for cloudy times and night, but would also not have batteries that would need replacement.

Finally, there was the goal that notifications be send to the owner of the fence. Here were the different alternatives that were suggested:
  - Wi-Fi shield
  - GMS shield
  - Xbee

The cons of using a Wi-Fi shield were that using Wi-Fi is not thinking globally because farms do not typically have Wi-Fi. Even in Andre’s case there is no Wi-Fi connection at the actual location of the electric fence. A GMS shield would work well, but it would require obtaining a network connection, which is not within our budget and would require continued payments. XBee's were the final idea. They can communicate between multiple arduinos and cheeper XBee's can communicate 300 feet, which would work well for what we need. Additionaly, XBee's are easy to use with Arduinos.

##Overview of Process:
To choose a solution we needed to decide on a power source, a measuring device, and a communication mechanism. For the power source, we determined that a combination of battery and solar power would be most efficient. A solar panel is used to harvest energy from the sun to recharge a battery that ultimately powers the product. This allows the battery to be fully charged during a sunny day and then run continuously overnight or for a period of cloudy days when sunlight is minimal.  The non-invasive current sensor proved to be the most realistic solution for determining whether or not the electric fence is running properly. High-voltage pulses from the electric fence can cause inaccuracies in voltmeter readings and can fry a standard current sensor.  In contrast, the non-invasive current sensor does not directly attach to the fence, but rather measures current by reading the magnetic field that surrounds the circuit. For communication, we decided to utilize arduinos in combination with XBees.  One arduino serves as the hub for the measuring device and the other serves as the hub in the user’s home that alerts them when the fence is down. An XBee accompanies each arduino to allow them to communicate. When the fence is down, the low current reading from the non-invasive current sensor triggers the XBee to send a message to the home arduino’s XBee, which then causes the home arduino to alert the user. 


##Testing & Anaylsis
- Critical Parts & Analysis

The critical part of our whole design, on which we presented, was determined to be the XBee modules working with the Arduinos and communicating with each other.  As such, we had to make sure that our code was correct and that our XBees could in fact talk to each other effectively.  This proved a success, and our presentation ultimately went well.  Under analysis, our Arduino seems to be reading currents correctly, even after soldering its components to the prototyping board. The XBees are communicating correctly and are outputting readings that make sense.  
- Testing

We tested the product at Jacob Springs farm on two occasions. The first time, we did so with only our prototype to ensure that the non-invasive current sensor could successfully detect whether the electric fence is on. We moved on in our design once we knew that it produced reliable readings. After the completion of our final product, we again went to Jacob Springs Farm to check again that the current sensor functions as well as to determine the effectiveness of the XBee communication. The current sensor successfully detected the functionality of the electric fence and then successfully transmitted the command to turn on the led on the home arduino. We tested the maximum distance of the XBee communication and found that 300 feet is the approximate maximum distance. This means that the home arduino will be able to recieve messages from the fence arduino when it is positioned in Andre's house, which is approximately 250 feet from the fence.

##Final Design
- Description: Our final design has to be able to detect when the client's electric fence is down and relay this information to the client. Additionally it has to be powered consistently, and endure exposure to weather. It consists of the following components which allow it to meet these requirements.
  - Non invasive current sensor: This is arguably the most important part of the design. It allows the device to detect when there is no current in the fence. A non invasive current sensor uses the magnetic fields created by the current moving through the wire in order to infer the current that is passing through it. This method of obtaining the current is important to the project, as a simple ammeter could easily be damaged by the high voltage that passes through an electric fence. The non invasive current sensor doesn't need to be in contact with the fence to pick up a current meaning it won't be damaged. 
  - Arduino RedBoard: The RedBoard processes the information received by the current sensor in order to allow us to decide when to send messages to the client. It will send a message whenever the current picked up by the current sensor hits 0 a certain number of times in a specific time frame. This will prevent messages from being sent every time the sensor randomly picks up a 0. 
  - Xbees/GSM Shield: This component is what allows the device to communicate with the client. We currently have two plans for how to accomplish this. The first is the ideal plan, which is to use the GSM shield. This will allow the device to send a text message to the client when the fence is down. This is ideal as the client can be anywhere and as long as they have their phone, they will receive the message immediately. It's drawbacks are caused by time constraints and potential financial constraints. If it turns out we don't have the time or money to implement this component, we will instead use Xbees. Xbees allow for two arduinos to communicate with each other. Using these we could have the device communicate with a seperate arduino located somewhere more accessable to the client. This seperate arduino would be fitted with an LED light which lights up when the fence is down. This is less ideal as it is more work for the client to make sure to check it, however it easily fits into our budget and timeline therefore if the first plan fails this is a solid backup. 
  - Pelican weatherproof case: This allows the device to withstand any weather conditions. It houses the Redboard, the XBee and the batteries.
  - Solar Panel + Rechargeable Batteries: This component is for powering the device. With the solar panel, the device is able to draw power without having to be plugged in. This is important as the electric fence is located outside, and there was a possibility of another power supply not being available. The rechargeable batteries allow the power supply to be consistent. The solar panel charges the batteries which supply the device. This means that even at night, or during the rain, the device should still receive power. 
- Manufacturing Process: This project was not very manufacturing heavy, however there were a few things that needed to be built. The first part was getting the sensor hooked up to the redboard. This simply involved building the circuit for it, and getting a connecting piece to allow us to attach the sensor to the bread board. the next step involved attaching the xbees. In order to do this we required an xbee shield with stackable headers, which would be soldered to the shield then plugged in to the redboard. Following this the circuit on the breadboard needed to be soldered to the shield. The same needed to be done for the shield and redboard containing the receiving xbee and the LEDs. The next step involves the power supply. The batteries need to be hooked up and plugged in to the redboard, as well as the solar panel to charge them. Finally the portion of the device that is on the electric fence needs to be placed in the weatherproof case. First a hole needed to be drilled in the case in order for the wires connecting the solar panel and the sensor to reach inside, then the redboard and batteries needed to be placed inside, and the hole sealed. 

##Conclusion
-The problem our project fixed was notifying our client when his electric fence has lost functionality. We used two Arduino Redboards, two XBees, two XBee shields, a non-invasive current sensor, rechargable batteries, and a solar panel, as well as wires, capacitors, and resistors to complete the circuit on our boards. The non-invasive current sensor is extremely important as it is the sole component which obatins the current reading from the fence. The XBees allow the two arduino boards to communicate with eachother, letting Andre know that his fence is down without him having to go out to the fence itself. Our Arduino that will be obtaining the current reading from the electric fence is enclosed in a waterproof Pelican case, protecting it from undesirable weather conditions (which will be occurring often now that it is Winter). The solar panel is attached to a pack containing rechargable batteries, which allows the solar panel to recharge the batteries. The batteries we have will be able to last a few days without sunlight before they will need to be charged; however, as long as there are sunny days, the batteries will be continuously recharged. Although our project was not very manufacturing heavy, it involved a lot of coding. We had to code the non-invasive current sensor, the two XBees, and we had to write our own code which determined when the actual fence itself was not working. The second arduino, that will be located in Andre's house (or wherever he so chooses to place it) is enclosed in an acrylic casing. There is a red LED light that is on this arduino - when the light is on, the electric fence is not working. When the light is off, the fence is working fine.

For anyone tackling projects such as this one, I would suggest to always stay on top of your work. Use all of your class time wisely, because if you do not, you will just have to make up that time outside of class. I would also advise to come into each class with a goal that you would like to complete - even if it is just a small one - because some progress is better than none. In addition, stay in constant contact with your group members. It is a good feeling knowing that your members are each completing their respective assignments and if anyone needs help you know that someone will be there to assist you. Finally, don't wait for one specific task to get done before you start on another. If one task can't get done for whatever reason (i.e a piece you need for your project hasn't arrived yet) then move on to the next. It's a big waste of time and will only hurt you. Besides that, just stay on top of your work, stay positive, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
