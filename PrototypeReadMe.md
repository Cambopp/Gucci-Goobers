 
##Prototype
  The Prototype of the project was completed on October, 22. The main function of this prototype was measuring current using a non-invasive current sensor and outputting, for readings of zero, that the fence is down. Constructing the project mainly involved wireing the sensor with arduino and then programing it. A major challenge that arose was that the non-invasive current sensor has an output in the form of a audion jack. A adapter had to be acuired and then played around with in order to wire it correctly. The code was acuired from sample code on Spark Fun's website and then edited to fit the needs of the project. The protype was tested on a basic circuit as well as pulsing current created from a waveform generator and gave accurate readings. At the time of presentation the shortcoming of the prototype was that it had not yet to be tested on an actual electric fence. Once tested on the fence, the code will most likely need to be tweaked to include dealys and accomodate for unforseen issues.
